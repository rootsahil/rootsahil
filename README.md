# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Sahil

**MEng Computing @ Imperial College London**  
I like building practical systems that run for real people - from low-level OS work to production ML services.

- ðŸ”­ Recently: built and deployed a **medical imaging inference service** end to end  
  FastAPI Â· Docker Â· AWS (ECR, ECS Fargate) Â· TensorFlow/Keras Â· monitoring and health checks
- ðŸ§  Interests: **systems**, **distributed storage**, **compilers**, and **applied ML**
- ðŸ“š Currently exploring: **C++ concurrency**, **identity & auth patterns**, and **Databricks/PySpark**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: **Dockerizing ML**, **CI workflows**, **DHTs**, **AArch64**

## ðŸš€ Highlights

### AI Research Scholar - Medical Imaging (Google DeepMind Ã— Imperial)
- Built CNN and Vision Transformer models on **4,000+ X-rays**, reaching **85% accuracy**
- Productionised the model: **FastAPI** service with request validation and batching
- Containerised with **Docker**, pushed to registry, deployed on **AWS** (ECR + ECS Fargate)
- Added health checks, centralised logging, and clean release notes for collaborators

### Kademlia-Based Distributed File Storage (Go)
- Secure P2P storage with a custom TCP transport, content-addressable storage (SHA-1), and AES-CTR
- Implemented a **Kademlia-style DHT** for scalable peer discovery and resilience

### PintOS
- Added a **virtual memory system**: demand paging, swapping, memory-mapped I/O
- Implemented synchronisation primitives with **nested priority donation** and a preemptive BSD scheduler
- Exposed **10+ POSIX-like syscalls** with robust userâ€“kernel memory handling

### WACC Compiler (Scala â†’ AArch64)
- Full compiler pipeline using a **Three-Address Code (TAC) IR**
- Optimisations (CFG analysis, LICM, peephole) yielding up to **2.09Ã—** speedups
- **470+ tests** passing in CI

## ðŸ§° Toolbox

**Languages:** C, C++, Go, Python, Scala, Java, Kotlin, Haskell, SQL (Postgres), JavaScript/HTML/CSS  
**ML / Data:** TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, basic PyTorch, sklearn; evaluation & reproducibility  
**Systems:** Docker, GitHub Actions / GitLab CI, QEMU, GDB, SSH, WSL  
**Cloud:** AWS (ECR, ECS Fargate, CloudWatch), basic IaC patterns  
**Web:** FastAPI, REST, a bit of Svelte/React

## âœ… What I care about

- Clear interfaces, good invariants, and tests that actually fail when they should  
- Observability by default: logs, metrics, health endpoints  
- Secure by default: least privilege, request validation, sane timeouts  
- Reproducibility: pinned deps, deterministic builds, small images
